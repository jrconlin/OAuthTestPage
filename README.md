OAuthTestPage
====

OAuth can be confusing. This page helps clear away some of the magic.

Go to the [Test Page](http://jrconlin.github.com/OAuthTestPage/) served on github.

This page uses my [OAuthSimple Javascript library](https://github.com/jrconlin/oauthsimple) to show you the values being exchanged. It's most useful if you are building your own client or server library and want to be able to replicate calls and test parameter values.

The URLs being generated are valid against OAuth 1.0a. You do not need this page if you are using OAuth 2.0, since it's less secure and relies on SSL.

And yes, if you're a UI/UX wizard and want to help out a geek with limited skills in that area, your contributions are MORE THAN WELCOME!
